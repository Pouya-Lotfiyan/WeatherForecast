# WeatherForecast
This repository represents a simple android app which only shows weather conditions of Tehran 
I just made  a simple app for using retrofit and training more.

# Web Server 
in this project I just use retrofit library which is literarlly useful for getting data from a web server 
The web Server which I used to get the weather data is https://developer.accuweather.com
to use this project you should login in the website and get your own apikey 
note that I use 5day forecast in this project and if you want to use a diffrent model you have to customize the code 

# GUI
All GUIs are designed by my friend MohammadReza Tavakoli
